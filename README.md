Hey, I'm Reed. I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas. I study computer science, mechanical engineering, and I love a good debate. The primary area of my expertise is in 3D design, light coding projects, and physics. I am looking to expand my knowledge of aerospace engineering throughout the rest of my educational career.
